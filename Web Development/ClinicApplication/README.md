# ClinicApplication
An user friendly web application using PHP, HTML, CSS and JS to automate a clinicâ€™s day to day activities such as appointment scheduling, reminders, templating, reporting and payments.

## Motivation
There is a lack of transperancy in many clinics in terms of payment and reporting. Employees can manipulate payments and reports can be mishandled. This applications aims to bring consistency in report generation and payment in clinics in order to have a streamlined process for the patients. This would also allow the owner to generate reports based on the payments recieved whenever required at the click of a button.

## Problems we aim to tackle
- **Lack of transperancy in recieveing payments**
    Employees can steal portions of the payments, make changes in the bills and can do many other manipulations which may hurt the clinic's overall income. 
- **Mishandling of reports**
    Reports can get exchanged, lost or damaged. 
- **Ease of visualizing cash flow**
    All the processing on the clinic's data can be done at a click of a button by the owner.
