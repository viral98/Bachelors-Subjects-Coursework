# Food-Ordering-System
A mini project for the web development course in bachelors.

## Detail
- **Data collection**
    The orders can be taken via a web interface made over PHP, HTML, CSS. This interface allows a user to select the quantity of items and shows their
    invoce at the end of the order. It also allows for Cash on delivery and Card payment options however the later feature is for
    example purposes only. It also has a ticket management system in its early stages, allowing for issuing tickets for orders which
    do not meet standards.
- **Data storage**
    Data storage happens in MySQL. 
- **Data Retrival**
    For retrival, we have a seperate admin interface allowing for quick and easy access to orders.
